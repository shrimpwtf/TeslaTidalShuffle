Shuffle Tidal Playlists because Tesla's Tidal App STILL can't

Precompiled binaries are included in the releases tab, just extract them and run from your console if on osx/linux or double click the exe if on windows

Incredibly self explanitory to use, tells you what to do as you're doing it.

Uses some libraries from https://github.com/Zibbp/tidal-utils/ for functionality, thanks for making these public <3
